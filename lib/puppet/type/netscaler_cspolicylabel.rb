* HTTP - Supports policies that process HTTP traffic. Used to access unencrypted Web sites. (The default.)
* SSL - Supports policies that process HTTPS/SSL encrypted traffic. Used to access encrypted Web sites.
* TCP - Supports policies that process any type of TCP traffic, including HTTP.
* SSL_TCP - Supports policies that process SSL-encrypted TCP traffic, including SSL.
* UDP - Supports policies that process any type of UDP-based traffic, including DNS.
* DNS - Supports policies that process DNS traffic.
* ANY - Supports all types of policies except HTTP, SSL, and TCP.
* SIP_UDP - Supports policies that process UDP based Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic. SIP initiates, manages, and terminates multimedia communications sessions, and has emerged as the standard for Internet telephony (VoIP).
* RTSP - Supports policies that process Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) traffic. RTSP provides delivery of multimedia and other streaming data, such as audio, video, and other types of streamed media.
* RADIUS - Supports policies that process Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) traffic. RADIUS supports combined authentication, authorization, and auditing services for network management.
* MYSQL - Supports policies that process MYSQL traffic.
* MSSQL - Supports policies that process Microsoft SQL traffic."
